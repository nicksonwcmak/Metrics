# Metrics

A simple project to implement various metrics in Java.
The purpose of this project is to review concepts of inheritance and unit testing, as well as review the metric concept from my Math courses.

To implement:
1. Hamming distance.
2. Absolute value distance. Use array to represent tuple?
3. Manhattan distance.
4. Any other interesting metrics I come across.
5. (Challenging?) p-adic distance (for simplicity, only over integers? Only for one specific prime?)
