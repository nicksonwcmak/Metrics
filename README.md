# Metrics

A simple project to implement various metrics in Java.
The purpose of this project is to review concepts of inheritance and unit testing, as well as review the metric concept from my Math courses.

To implement:
1. Hamming distance. (Use charAt to iterate over a string: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/196830/what-is-the-easiest-best-most-correct-way-to-iterate-through-the-characters-of-a
2. Absolute value distance. Use tuples.
3. Manhattan distance.
4. Any other interesting metrics I come across.
